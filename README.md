# World Energy Consumption Analysis & Dashboard

This project provides an in-depth exploration of global energy consumption using data-driven techniques.
It combines Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) with a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key trends and forecast energy usage patterns.

# Project Objectives
Analyze historical energy consumption patterns globally.

Identify top consumers and emerging trends in energy use.

Clean and preprocess the data for effective modeling.

Visualize energy distribution, carbon emissions, and consumption metrics.

Build a predictive model to forecast future energy usage.

Create a user-friendly Power BI dashboard to present insights interactively.

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Power BI)

# Key Features
üìà EDA: In-depth analysis of country-wise and energy-type-wise consumption.

üßπ Data Cleaning: Missing values handled, units standardized, and relevant features selected.

üîç Visualizations: Bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and more using Python and Power BI.

ü§ñ Machine Learning Model: Forecasting future consumption trends using regression techniques.

üìä Power BI Dashboard: An interactive dashboard offering filterable insights by country, energy type, and year.

# Getting Started
Clone the repo or download the files.

Open World_Energy_Consumption_Project.ipynb.
